//This is a running log of all the days and their answers. It will output each day (that I have completed) and their seperate parts individually
//if you wish to test each day individually, comment out other days lines
//and finally, if you want to test it against your input (cheater), then replace the text in the individual bins of each folder. Hope you enjoy!

//Credit goes to @mohfez on github for the idea

//Day 1
Console.WriteLine($"Day: 1:   \n- part 1: {new Day1().Answer(false)}, part 2: {new Day1().Answer(true)}\n\n");

//Day 2
//Console.WriteLine($"Day: 2:   \n- part 1: {new Day2().Answer(1)}, part 2: {new Day2().Answer(2)}\n\n");
