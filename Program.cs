//This is a running log of all the days and their answers. It will output each day (that I have completed) and their seperate parts individually
//if you wish to test each day individually, comment out other days lines
//if you are stuck, I'd suggesting using the testcases that are provided by the website (or, if you are really stuck, compare your code with mine, or just try and understand the approach I used). 
//I purged my puzzle inputs from the github, and if you are curious why, read the README.md document.

//Credit goes to @mohfez on github for the idea

//Day 1
//Console.WriteLine($"Day: 1:   \n- part 1: {new Day1().Answer(false)}, part 2: {new Day1().Answer(true)}\n\n");

//Day 2
//Console.WriteLine($"Day: 2:   \n- part 1: {new Day2().Answer(false)}, part 2: {new Day2().Answer(true)}\n\n");

//Day 3
//Console.WriteLine($"Day: 3:   \n- part 1: {new Day3().Answer(false)}, part 2: {new Day3().Answer(true)}\n\n");

//Day 4
Console.WriteLine($"Day: 4:   \n- part 1: {new Day4().Answer(false)}, part 2: {new Day4().Answer(true)}\n\n");
