# Advent-of-Code-2023
(This is even worse than last year)

## Description
This repository is a storage unit for all my advent of code solutions for 2023. This time there will be comments as I actually care about readability this time... kind of. 
I'd suggest having a go at the problems yourself beforehand and then comparing it with my (or others) solutions.

## My review of this years Advent of Code
Can't criticise just yet, but I must admit, day 1 was a pain to handle (specifically part 2)

Day 2 was far easier. Because I can't read, the description caught me a little off guard, but both parts were reasonable this time

Day 3 was... medium. Grid problems are always the bane of my existence on advent of code, though.

Day 4... Regex carried a lot here. Probably the easiest by far to deal with. All of them feel like parsing problems, though.

Day 5 was hard. Part 1's description threw me off for a bit, and part 2 was awful since I knew I couldn't just brute-force my way to the answer. I got it though, but I really hope the next few days are easier for my sanity

Day 6 was the easiest by far. I initially bruteforced the solution, and even though it was fast, there was an even *FASTER* solution, which I obviously copied.

Day 7 was the longest for me by far. It wasn't necessarily hard, per-se, but it was just really monotonous as I had to do many things before even getting close to the solution (which was first parse the input, sort, then add the sums. Easier said than done)

Day 8 was... interesting. It was a bit difficult (Day 5 was still the worst), and I couldn't just brute-force my way to the part 2 solution even if I wanted (I predicted it would've took 15 days. I dont have that much time and electricity). Was quite satisfying when I got the solution, though!

Day 9 was deceptively easy. I brute-forced my way to the solution using recursion, but I thought I would have to do some maths to get a fast solution. Luckily, brute-force worked just fine. I'll probably look around for a better solution though. Part 2 was a joke for Day 9.

Day 10. Well, a solution is a solution I guess...

Day 11 was the fastest for me yet. I guess once you do day 10 and suffer through it for ages, day 11 just feels incredibly easy, even though it's not (day 6 was)

Day 12 I was unable to get more than 1 star (as of writing). Sad day. Also ruined my flow and as such didn't stick with doing the advent of codes on the days they're given

Day 13 was a fresh breath of air... from day 12 hell. Wasn't too bad

Day 14 I found alright. I had to hard-code in certain parts of my code, which isn't alright, but it runs

Day 15 was easy. No other comments

Day 16 I had to bruteforce. Sad day, as I couldn't use memoization for it like I had hoped (still runs in ~1 second so it's nothing too awful)

(they have better solutions than mine, since they have been coding far longer than I)

PS. if you're uploading your puzzle inputs alongside your code, I'd suggest removing it. Most people look at the code over the inputs anyway, and bad actors can use it to clone/steal the website (via reverse engineering)

If it passes the testcase provided by the website but not your puzzle input (happened to me for day 1 part 2), try looking around for example testcases people have created, or asking why your code doesn't work. Good luck and have fun with this years Advent of Code!
