# Advent-of-Code-2023
(This is even worse than last year)

## Description
This repository is a storage unit for all my advent of code solutions for 2023. This time there will be comments as I actually care about readability this time... kind of. 
I'd suggest having a go at the problems yourself beforehand and then comparing it with my (or others) solutions.

## My review of this years Advent of Code
Can't criticise just yet, but I must admit, day 1 was a pain to handle (specifically part 2)

Day 2 was far easier. Because I can't read, the description caught me a little off guard, but both parts were reasonable this time

Day 3 was also easy. Grid problems are always the bane of my existence on advent of code, though.

(they have better solutions than mine, since they have been coding far longer than I)
