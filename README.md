# Advent-of-Code-2023
(This is even worse than last year)

## Description
This repository is a storage unit for all my advent of code solutions for 2023. This time there will be comments as I actually care about readability this time... kind of. 
I'd suggest having a go at the problems yourself beforehand and then comparing it with my (or others) solutions.

## My review of this years Advent of Code
Can't criticise just yet, but I must admit, day 1 was a pain to handle (specifically part 2)

Day 2 was far easier. Because I can't read, the description caught me a little off guard, but both parts were reasonable this time

Day 3 was... medium. Grid problems are always the bane of my existence on advent of code, though.

Day 4... Regex carried a lot here. Probably the easiest by far to deal with. All of them feel like parsing problems, though.

Day 5 was hard. Part 1's description threw me off for a bit, and part 2 was awful since I knew I couldn't just brute-force my way to the answer. I got it though, but I really hope the next few days are easier for my sanity

## Miscellanous

(they have better solutions than mine, since they have been coding far longer than I)

PS. if you're uploading your puzzle inputs alongside your code, I'd suggest removing it. Most people look at the code over the inputs anyway, and bad actors can use it to clone/steal the website (via reverse engineering)

If it passes the testcase provided by the website but not your puzzle input (happened to me for day 1 part 2), try looking around for example testcases people have created, or asking why your code doesn't work. Good luck and have fun with this years Advent of Code!
