# Advent-of-Code-2023
This is even worse than last year

Is a storage unit for all my advent of code solutions for 2023. This time there will be comments as I actually care about readability this time... kind of. I'd suggest having a go at the problems yourself beforehand and then comparing it with my (or others) solutions.
Example of others who do Advent of Code: 

###@mohfez
###@VictorVictini (https://stackoverflow.com)[website]

(they have better solutions than mine, since they have been coding far longer than I)
